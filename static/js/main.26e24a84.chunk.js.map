In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an\n    Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote\n    the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee\n    and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint\n    request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.\n    In his personal notes from 1990 he listed some of the many areas in\n    which hypertext is used and put an encyclopedia first.The first publicly\n    available description of HTML was a document called HTML Tags, first\n    mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describe\n    18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.\n    Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,\n    an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based\n    documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in\n    HTML 4. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and\n    compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.\n    Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the\n    browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web\n    page designers additional use of CSS.Many of the text elements are found\n    in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which\n    in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that\n    used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS\n    (Compatible Time- Sharing System) operating system: these formatting\n    commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually\n    format documents.However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is \n    based on elements(nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather\n    than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure\n    and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'tab-2',\n    title: 'CSS',\n    content: `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language\n    used for describing the presentation of a document written in a\n    markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology \n    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed\n    to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,\n    colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,\n    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation\n    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying\n    the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and\n    repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and\n    content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different\n    styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,\n    by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based\n    tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the \n    content is accessed on a mobile.`,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'tab-3',\n    title: 'JavaScript',\n    content: `JavaScript and Java are two different computer languages, both\n    developed in 1995. Java is an object-oriented programming language, which\n    means it can run independently in a machine environment. It is a reliable,\n    versatile language used for Android apps, enterprise systems that move\n    large amounts of data (especially in the finance industry), and embedded\n    functions for \"Internet of Things\" technologies (IoT). JavaScript, on the\n    other hand, is a text-based programming language meant to run as part of a\n    web-based application. When first developed, it was intended to be a\n    compliment to Java. But JavaScript took on a life of its own as one of\n    the three pillars of web developmentâ€”the other two being HTML and CSS.\n    Unlike Java applications, which need to be compiled before they can run\n    in a web-based environment, JavaScript was purposely designed to integrate\n    into HTML. All major web browsers support JavaScript, though most give\n    users the option of disabling support for it. Using and Writing JavaScript\n    What makes JavaScript great is that its not necessary to know how to write\n    it to use it in your web code. You can find plenty of prewritten JavaScripts\n    for free online. To use such scripts, all you need to know is how to paste\n    the supplied code into the right places on your web page. Despite the easy\n    access to prewritten scripts, many coders prefer knowing how to do it\n    themselves. Because it is an interpreted language, no special program is\n    required to create usable code. A plain text editor like Notepad for Windows\n    is all you need to write JavaScript. That said, Markdown Editor might make\n    the process easier, particularly as the lines of code add up.`,\n  },\n];\n\nexport default TabsData;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Tabs from './Tabs';\nimport TabsData from '../TabsData';\n\nfunction TabsPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"tabs-page-content\">\n      <h3>Tabs Page</h3>\n      <Tabs\n        TabsData={TabsData}\n        tabId={props.match.params.tabId}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default TabsPage;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nfunction HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"home-page-content\">\n      <h3>Home Page</h3>\n      <p className=\"content-text\">\n        Web  development is the work involved in developing a web\n        site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet\n        (a private network). Web development can range from\n        developing a simple single static page of plain\n        text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),\n        electronic businesses, and social network services.\n        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development\n        commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design,\n        web content development, client liaison,\n        client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network\n        security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among\n        web professionals, web development usually refers to the\n        main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing\n        markup and coding. Web development may use content\n        management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier\n        and available with basic technical skills. For larger\n        organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist\n        of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard\n        methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites.\n        Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent\n        or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related\n        job positions such as a graphic designer or information\n        systems technician.

Front-end developers responsible\n        for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,\n        while back-end developers deal with the servers.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default HomePage;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"footer-element\">\n      <footer>Task: Tabs with react-dom-router</footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { NavLink, HashRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport './App.css';\nimport TabsPage from './components/TabsPage';\nimport HomePage from './components/HomePage';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <HashRouter>\n      <div className=\"app\">\n        <nav className=\"nav-bar\">\n          <NavLink\n            className=\"hlink\"\n            to=\"/\"\n            activeClassName=\"active\"\n            exact\n          >\n            Home\n          </NavLink>\n          <NavLink\n            className=\"tlink\"\n            to=\"/TabsData\"\n            activeClassName=\"active\"\n            exact\n          >\n            Tabs\n          </NavLink>\n        </nav>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={HomePage} />\n        <Route path=\"/TabsData/:tabId?\" component={TabsPage} />\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    </HashRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
